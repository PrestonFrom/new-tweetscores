# Updated Twitter-based ideal points (2021)

This repository hosts code and data for a new set of Twitter-based ideal points,
calculated using the correspondence-analysis-based method developed by Pablo
Barberá in his *Psychological Science*
[paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797615594620). We use the
streamlined method he documents in his [2020
update](https://github.com/pablobarbera/twitter_ideology/tree/master/2020-update). 

As input, we use a snapshot of following data from the Lazer Lab's panel of
Twitter users. The snapshot was collected from September 19, 2020 to January
7, 2021. The composition of the panel, details on its construction, and other
details can be found in [Hughes et al
2021](https://sdmccabe.github.io/files/hughes_constructing_2020.pdf) and
[Shugars et al 2021](https://journalqd.org/article/view/2570).

The elite-level ideal points (φ in the original paper) are stored in this
repository. The user-level ideal points (θ) are not (we generally don't post the
user IDs of the panel members, and also the full dataset is too large to commit
to Github).
